Terminal Profiles
=================

The macOS Terminal app's configuration is stored in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist`. As far as I can tell there aren't any secrets stored in this `plist`. YMMV, give yours a quick eye-ball before putting on Teh Internets...

NOTE: This configuration requires a shell executable in `/usr/local/bin/bash`. You should probably install a `bash` duplicate with `homebrew` before loading this profile.
